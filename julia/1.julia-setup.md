## Setup Julia development environment in mainland China

### Step 1: Installing Julia 
For Linux/Mac users, please open a terminal and type the following command to install [Julia](https://julialang.org/) with [juliaup](https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup). `Juliaup` is a tool to manage Julia versions and installations. It allows you to install multiple versions of Julia and switch between them easily.

```
curl -fsSL https://install.julialang.org | sh
```

For Windows users, please open execute the following command in a `cmd`,
```
winget install julia -s msstore
```
You can also install Juliaup directly from [Windows Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9NJNWW8PVKMN).


#### For users suffering from the slow download speed
            
You may need to specify another server for installing Juliaup. To do so, execute the following command in your terminal before running the script above.

**Linux and macOS**
```bash
export JULIAUP_SERVER=https://mirror.nju.edu.cn/julia-releases/
```
**Windows**
```PowerShell
$env:JULIAUP_SERVER="https://mirror.nju.edu.cn/julia-releases/"
```
An alternative approach is downloading the corresponding Julia binary from the [Nanjing university mirror website](https://mirror.nju.edu.cn/julia-releases/).
After installing the binary, please set the Julia binary path properly if you want to start a Julia REPL from a terminal, check this [manual page](https://julialang.org/downloads/platform/) to learn more.


#### Installing Julia
Once you have installed Juliaup, you can install Julia by running the following command in your terminal.
  ```bash
  juliaup default 1.9
  ```
To verify that Julia is installed, run the following command in your terminal.
  ```bash
  julia
  ```
- It should start a Julia REPL(Read-Eval-Print-Loop) session like this
![REPL Session](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:4800/format:webp/1*lxjWRvH3EzSa1N3Pg4iNag.png)
- If you wish to install a specific version of Julia, please refer to the [documentation](https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup).

### Step 2: Package Management
- `Julia` has a mature eco-system for scientific computing.
- 'Pkg' is the built-in package manager for Julia.
- To enter the package manager, press `]` in the REPL.
![PackageMangement](https://github.com/exAClior/QMBCTutorial/blob/ys/julia-tutorial/notebooks/resources/scripts/Packages.gif?raw=true)
- The environment is indicated by the `(@v1.9)`.
- To add a package, type `add <package name>`.
- To exit the package manager press `backspace` key

#### First Package: PkgServerClient.jl
- Due to some special reasons, we need to install `PkgServerClient.jl` first.
- You should first execute the following command

  **Linux and macOS**
  ```bash
    export JULIA_PKG_SERVER='https://mirrors.nju.edu.cn/julia'
  ```

  **Windows**
  ```PowerShell
    $env:JULIA_PKG_SERVER='https://mirrors.nju.edu.cn/julia'
  ```
- Then you can add `PkgServerClient.jl` by typing `add PkgServerClient` in the package manager.
- To make sure Julia uses the package automatically at startup, configure the `startup.jl` file.

#### More Packages
- You may find more packages for scientific computing [here](https://juliahub.com/).

### Step 3. Configure the startup file and add `Revise`
First create a new file `.julia/config/startup.jl` with the following content

```julia
try
    using Revise
catch e
    @warn "fail to load Revise."
end
```

The contents in the startup file is executed immediately after you open a new Julia session.

Then you need to install [Revise](https://github.com/timholy/Revise.jl), which is an Julia package that can greatly improve the using experience of Julia. To install `Revise`, open Julia REPL and type
```julia
julia> using Pkg; Pkg.add("Revise")
```
To exit Julia REPL, just press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>D</kbd>.

As a final step, please verify your Julia configuration by openning a Julia REPL and type
```julia
julia> versioninfo()
Julia Version 1.8.2
Commit 36034abf260 (2022-09-29 15:21 UTC)
Platform Info:
  OS: Linux (x86_64-linux-gnu)
  CPU: 8 Ã— Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-10510U CPU @ 1.80GHz
  WORD_SIZE: 64
  LIBM: libopenlibm

```

#### Step 3. Download an editor: VSCode

Install VSCode by downloading the correct binary for your platform from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
Open VSCode and open the `Extensions` tab on the left side-bar of the window, search `Julia` and install the most popular extension.

You are ready to go, cheers!

### A quick introduction to the Julia REPL

A Julia REPL has four modes,

1. Julian mode is the default mode that can interpret your Julia code.

2. Shell mode is the mode that you can run shell commands. Press `;` in the Julian mode and type
```julia
shell> date
Sun Nov  6 10:50:21 PM CST 2022
```
To return to the Julian mode, type the <kbd>Backspace</kbd> key.

3. Package mode is the mode that you can manage packages. Press `]` in the Julian mode and type
```julia
(@v1.8) pkg> st
Status `~/.julia/environments/v1.8/Project.toml`
  [295af30f] Revise v3.4.0
```
To return to the Julian mode, type the <kbd>Backspace</kbd> key.

4. Help mode is the mode that you can access the docstrings of functions. Press `?` in the Julian mode and type
```julia
help> sum
... docstring for sum ...
```
To return to the Julian mode, type the <kbd>Backspace</kbd> key.
