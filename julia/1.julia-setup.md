## Setup Julia development environment in mainland China

### Installation Guide

#### Step 1. Install/Update Julia binary
For Linux/Mac users, please open a terminal and type the following command to install [Julia](https://julialang.org/) with [juliaup](https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup)

```
curl -fsSL https://install.julialang.org | sh
```

For Windows users, please open execute the following command in a `cmd`,
```
winget install julia -s msstore
```

To open a Julia REPL, just type `julia` in a terminal or click the Julia Icon in Windows.

##### For users suffering from the slow download speed

An alternative approach is downloading the corresponding Julia binary from the [Nanjing university mirror website](https://mirror.nju.edu.cn/julia-releases/).
After installing the binary, please set the Julia binary path properly if you want to start a Julia REPL from a terminal, check this [manual page](https://julialang.org/downloads/platform/) to learn more.

#### Step 2. Configure the package source and `Revise` in the startup file
First create a new file `.julia/config/startup.jl` with the following content

```julia
ENV["JULIA_PKG_SERVER"] = "http://cn-southeast.pkg.juliacn.com/"
try
    using Revise
catch e
    @warn "fail to load Revise."
end
```

The contents in the startup file is executed immediately after you open a new Julia session.

Then you need to install [Revise](https://github.com/timholy/Revise.jl), which is an Julia package that can greatly improve the using experience of Julia. To install `Revise`, open Julia REPL and type
```julia
julia> using Pkg; Pkg.add("Revise")
```
To exit Julia REPL, just press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>D</kbd>.

As a final step, please your Julia configuration by openning a Julia REPL and type
```julia
julia> versioninfo()
Julia Version 1.8.2
Commit 36034abf260 (2022-09-29 15:21 UTC)

Please make sure your `JULIA_PKG_SERVER` is set properly.

#### Step 3. Download an editor: VSCode

Install VSCode by downloading the correct binary for your platform from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
Open VSCode and open the `Extensions` tab on the left side-bar of the window, search `Julia` and install the most popular extension.

You are ready to go, cheers!

### A quick introduction to the Julia REPL

A Julia REPL has four modes,

1. Julian mode is the default mode that can interpret your Julia code.

2. Shell mode is the mode that you can run shell commands. Press `;` in the Julian mode and type
```julia
shell> date
Sun Nov  6 10:50:21 PM CST 2022
```
To return to the Julian mode, type the <kbd>Backspace</kbd> key.

3. Package mode is the mode that you can manage packages. Press `]` in the Julian mode and type
```julia
(@v1.8) pkg> st
Status `~/.julia/environments/v1.8/Project.toml`
  [295af30f] Revise v3.4.0
```
To return to the Julian mode, type the <kbd>Backspace</kbd> key.

4. Help mode is the mode that you can access the docstrings of functions. Press `?` in the Julian mode and type
```julia
help> sum
... docstring for sum ...
```
To return to the Julian mode, type the <kbd>Backspace</kbd> key.
